# mines
This is a clone of the game Minesweeper
this was made a final homework assignment for the O.O.P class that was taught using java
when i first did it there was no time to do everything i wanted so i finished it as a working game (the first commit)
later i decided to revisit it and make the changes that couldn't do the first time, like using the scenebuilder with the fxml file (second commit)

the game is Minesweeper 
there are three text fields that take in Height (how many rows), and the width (how many columns), and the number of the mines in the field
these fields are made for the player to be able to change the level of difficulty.
