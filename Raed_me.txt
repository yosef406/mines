added pictures to flag and mines and a closed spot

added popups if the player wins or losses 
	or adds too many mines (i made it alow only ((width * heght) / 3) ) to make the game more playable
	or ith the player enters letters or words in the text fields instead of numbers
	each are with there own indecating picture
also the game does nothing if the player wins or loses
used scenebuilder
most of the code is in the controller file
